## A Polkadot ecosystem index for investors. A self-sustaining auction treasury for parachains.

The Polkadot Index Network Token (PINT) is a token that enables protocols and individuals to easily gain diversified exposure to the top Polkadot ecosystem projects. Holders are exposed to the price movements and rewards of all of the assets within the PINT index. 
While many people (even the professionals) believe they should actively manage their portfolios, investing in an index is the best choice for most investors - just ask Warren Buffet. Index funds are popular because they enable ownership of a wide variety of assets, providing immediate diversification and lower risk. 

PINT operates as a DAO within the StakerDAO ecosystem, governed by a council of Polkadot ecosystem participants.
